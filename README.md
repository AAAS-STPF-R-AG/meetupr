## Installation

To install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```

A released version will be on CRAN soon.

## Usage

To use this package, you will first need to get your meetup API key. To
do so, go to this link: <https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/>

Once you have your key, save it as an environment variable by running
the following:

``` r
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_KEY = "PASTE YOUR MEETUP KEY HERE")
```

If you donâ€™t want to save it here, you can input it in each function
using the `api_key` parameter (just be sure not to send any documents
with your key to GitHub ðŸ™Š).

We currently have the following functions:

  - `get_members()`
  - `get_boards()`
  - `get_events()`  
  - `get_event_attendees()`  
  - `get_event_comments()`
  - `get_event_rsvps()`
  - `find_groups()`

Each will output a tibble with information extracted into from the API
as well as a `list-col` named `*_resource` with all API output. For
example, the following code will get all upcoming events for the
[R-Ladies San Francisco](https://meetup.com/rladies-san-francisco)
meetup.

``` r
library(meetupr)

urlname <- "rladies-san-francisco"
(events <- get_events(urlname))
#> Downloading 1 record(s)...
#> # A tibble: 1 x 21
#>   id     name    created             status time                local_date
#>   <chr>  <chr>   <dttm>              <chr>  <dttm>              <date>    
#> 1 25105â€¦ Automaâ€¦ 2018-05-23 16:34:47 upcomâ€¦ 2018-06-13 18:00:00 2018-06-13
#> # ... with 15 more variables: local_time <chr>, waitlist_count <int>,
#> #   yes_rsvp_count <int>, venue_id <int>, venue_name <chr>,
#> #   venue_lat <dbl>, venue_lon <dbl>, venue_address_1 <chr>,
#> #   venue_city <chr>, venue_state <chr>, venue_zip <chr>,
#> #   venue_country <chr>, description <chr>, link <chr>, resource <list>
```

## How can you contribute?

Take a look at some resources:

  - <https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/>
  - <https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/clients/>

In order to run our tests, you will have to set the `urlname` for meetup
you belong to as an environment variable using the following code:

``` r
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_NAME = "YOUR MEETUP NAME")
```

### TODO:

  - add tests
