## Installation

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr")
```
ðŸš§ **WARNING**: The package is undergoing a big re-org and we'd recommend that you install the "deprecated_etc" branch.  Many of the functions in the master branch will be deprecated and functions return tibbles now instead of lists.  To install that branch, do the following:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr", ref = "deprecated_etc")
```
The new version will be on CRAN soon.

## Usage

To use this package, you will first need to get your meetup API key. To do so, go to this link: [https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)

```{r}
library(meetupr)

api_key <- "INSERT_KEY_HERE"
group_name <- "INSERT THE NAME OF THE GROUP"

events <- get_events(group_name, api_key)
```

When you have your Meetup API key, you can set up an environment variable, by adding the following to your `.Rprofile`:

```{r}
Sys.setenv(meetup_api_key = "INSERT_KEY_HERE")
```
