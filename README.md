Installation
------------

You can install meetupr from github with:

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ **WARNING** ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§: The package is undergoing a big re-org and we'd recommend that you install the ["deprecated_etc"](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr/tree/deprecated_etc) branch instead of the master branch.  Many of the functions in the master branch will be deprecated and functions return tibbles now instead of lists.  

To install the "deprecated_etc" branch from GitHub:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rladies/meetupr", ref = "deprecated_etc")
```
The new version will be on CRAN soon.

Usage
-----

To use this package, you will first need to get your meetup API key. To do so, go to this link: <https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/>

Once you have your key, save it as an environment variable by running the following:

``` r
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_KEY = "PASTE YOUR MEETUP KEY HERE")
```

If you don't want to save it here, you can input it in each function using the `api_key` parameter (just be sure not to send any documents with your key to GitHub ðŸ™Š).

We currently have the following functions:

-   `get_members()`
-   `get_boards()`
-   `get_events()`
-   `get_event_attendees()`
-   `get_event_comments()`
-   `find_groups()`

Each will output a tibble with information extracted into from the API as well as a `list-col` named `*_resource` with all API output. For example, the following code will get all upcoming events for the [RLadies Nashville](https://meetup.com/rladies-nashville) meetup.

``` r
library(meetupr)

urlname <- "rladies-nashville"
(events <- get_events(urlname))
#> # A tibble: 2 x 5
#>          id                    name yes_rsvp_count                time
#>       <chr>                   <chr>          <int>              <dttm>
#> 1 243331077   Introduction to purrr             11 2017-11-14 00:00:00
#> 2 243331084 TBA with Laurie Samuels              5 2017-12-01 18:00:00
#> # ... with 1 more variables: resource <list>
```
